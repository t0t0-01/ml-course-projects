## Bike Sharing Predictions
Implemented a neural network from scratch in NumPy to predict bike rentals. Topics covered: neural networks, backpropagation, activation functions...
Dataset
Bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to the environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions, precipitation, day of week, season, hour of the day, etc. can affect the rental behaviors. The core data set is related to
the two-year historical log corresponding to years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA which is publicly available in http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data. We aggregated the data on two hourly and daily basis and then extracted and added the corresponding weather and seasonal information. Weather information are extracted from http://www.freemeteo.com.

## Dog Breed Classifier
Built a convolutional neural network using Tensorflow and Keras to classify any image (even an image of a human face) as a specific dog breed.
Main Tasks
  Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds from Scratch using Tensorflow and Keras  
  Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds using Transfer Learning from a VGG16 Model

## SVHN Image Classifier
Developed a feedforward/MLP neural network and a convolutional neural network classifier models for the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset.

## Sentiment Analyzer
Implemented a neural network using Tensorflow and Keras to classify text as either positive or negative.
